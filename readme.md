A **Task Management REST API** built with **Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL**.  

This project demonstrates **real backend engineering practices**: layered architecture, role-based authorization, validation, error handling, and type safety — not just CRUD functionality.

---

## 🚀 Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization (User / Admin)
- Task ownership rules
- Admin-only privileged actions
- Admin route to fetch all tasks for a specific user: `GET /tasks/user/:userId`
- PostgreSQL database with relational modeling
- Centralized error handling
- Request validation with **Joi**
- Clean separation of concerns (Routes → Controllers → Services)
- Fully type-safe Express setup with **TypeScript**

---

## 🏗 Architecture

Layered architecture ensures responsibilities are clear and code is maintainable:

```

Request
→ Middleware (Auth, Validation)
→ Controller
→ Service
→ Database (PostgreSQL)
← Service
← Controller
← Response

```

**Benefits:**

- Controllers stay thin
- Business rules centralized in services
- Database logic isolated
- Middleware handles cross-cutting concerns (auth, validation)
- Easier to test, extend, and refactor

## 🗄 Database

**PostgreSQL** is used as the primary data store:

- Relational schema for users and tasks
- One-to-many relationship: User → Tasks
- Ownership rules enforced in services
- Database logic isolated in a dedicated data layer

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication:**

- JWT-based, token required for all task routes
- Tokens signed using a server-side secret

**Authorization:**

- Users can access and modify **their own tasks only**
- Admins can access/manage **any task**
- Admins can fetch all tasks for a specific user: `GET /tasks/user/:id`
- Rules enforced **in the service layer**, not controllers

---

## 🧪 Validation

- Request body validation
- URL parameter validation
- Schema-driven approach with **Joi**
- Invalid requests are rejected **before hitting controllers**

---

## 🚨 Error Handling

- Centralized middleware handles all errors
- Services throw errors
- Controllers forward errors with `next(err)`
- Consistent response format
- No duplicated try/catch blocks

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
````

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/task_manager
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

### Run the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server will start at: `http://localhost:3000`
